# nyx-wizard
A relay setup wizard for Tor.

This wizard is a part of a larger code base, nyx (formerly arm), which is a terminal based Tor relay monitor for operators. I'm tinkering with this in the hopes of improving it, but I am not the original author. The nyx code base can be found [here](https://gitweb.torproject.org/nyx.git) and the wizard can be found [here](https://gitweb.torproject.org/nyx.git/tree/src/cli/wizard.py?h=release).
